    "[Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) is the discipline that studies methods to communicate secrets in such a way that any unauthorized listener would not be able to understand the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple cryptographic protocol could be changing every letter of your text following a fixed scheme (or *cypher*), for example by turning every A into a B, every B into a C and so on. However this is not a very secure method, for many reasons. One of them is that at some point the people who want to communicate need to agree on what method to use, and anyone listening to that conversation would be able to decypher every subsequent conversation. A public-key cryptographic protocol solves this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Public-key cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "Public-key cryptographic protocols, such as RSA, work like this: there are two keys, a *private* key that is only known to person A (traditionally called Alice in every example), and a *public* key that does not need to be secret.\n",
    "\n",
    "The public key is used to *encrypt* the message (that is to \"lock\" it, or \"hyde\" it), but one needs the private key to *decrypt* it. Imagine having two keys for your door, but one can only be used to lock it, while the other only to open it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The message exchange works like this: suppose that person B (Bob) wants to send a secret message to Alice. Then Alice secretely generates a private and a public key and sends only the public one to Bob. Now Bob encrypts the message and sends it to Alice, who can use her private key to decrypt it. Even if Eve (short for *eavesdropper*, an unauthorized listener) listens to every message exchanged, she won't be able to decypher the secret: the private key has never left Alice's house!\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that such a protocol is *asymmetric*: if Alice wanted to send a secret to Bob in reply, Bob would need to generate a pair of keys of his own.\n",
