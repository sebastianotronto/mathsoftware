However this is not a very secure method, for many reasons. One of them is that at some point the people who want to communicate need to agree on what method to use, and anyone listening to that conversation would be able to decypher every subsequent conversation. A public-key cryptographic protocol solves this problem.\n",

    "\n",
    "The message exchange works like this: suppose that person B (Bob) wants to send a secret message to Alice. Then Alice secretely generates a private and a public key and sends only the public one to Bob. Now Bob encrypts the message and sends it to Alice, who can use the private key to decrypt it. Even if Eve (short for *eavesdropper*, an unauthorized listener) listens to every message exchanged, she won't be able to decypher the secret: the private key has never left Alice's house!\n",
